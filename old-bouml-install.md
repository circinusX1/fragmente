 INSTALL BOUML FREE
Ubuntu 13 and 14 

This is a BOUML version prior to licensing stuff. BOUML release 4.21
Prerequisites:

    Ubuntu: Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS

 - You  might be missing more dependencies, because I might have them installed but this is the procedure.

    Goto http://www.ubuntuupdates.org/package/core/precise/universe/base/bouml or download the 64 bit version from here
    Goto https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/quantal/amd64/libqt3-mt/3:3.3.8-b-8ubuntu3    or download the deb package from here
    Goto https://packages.debian.org/sid/amd64/libmng1/download  or download it from here
    Goto https://packages.debian.org/sid/amd64/libjpeg62-turbo/download or download the deb from here 
     
    Install packages in reverse order
    If you run in a package you dont have, search it and install it. On my machine I just need the libqt3-mt, libmng1 and libjpeg62-turbo
    or http://http.us.debian.org/debian/pool/main/libj/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg62-turbo_1.3.1-12_amd64.deb

The bouml should be available under Main Menu - > Programming
